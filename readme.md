A linktree/linkinbio alternative that is powered by Telegram. This is the Telegram bot that powers gmon.link, written in Typescript & powered by grammY, and Supabase.

## Help build gmon.link

Submit a PR to the [gmon.link](https://github.com/Monad-Pad/gmon.link) repository.

# Setting it up locally
To setup the back-end (bot) of gmon.link locally to for example; help contribute to the platform or play around with it. You need to follow the following steps:

## 1. Create a new Telegram bot
- Open Telegram, search for @BotFather and open the chat
- Send the `/newbot` command and follow the instructions
- Note the token, you will need to add it to the `.env` file

## 2. Setting up the Database
Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Monad-Pad/gmon.link?tab=readme-ov-file#1-setting-up-the-database) to setup the database.

## 3. Setting up the Bot
Now that you've setup the database, you can start setting up the bot.

Let's start by forking the repository, click `Fork` in the top right corner. A pop-up will appear, you can leave the default options there and just click `Create fork`. After a few seconds, you should be redirected to your own copy of the repository.

Open the forked repository in your favourite IDE, we recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://cursor.com/).

### 3.1. Install dependencies
To install the dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3.2. Setup environment variables
Open the `.env.example` file and clone the values to a new file called `.env`.

You will see the following environment variables:
```bash
BOT_TOKEN=
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_KEY=
JWT_SECRET=
BOT_MODE=
```

- `BOT_TOKEN`: The token of the bot you created in step 1.
- `SUPABASE_URL`: The URL of the Supabase project you created in step 2.
- `SUPABASE_KEY`: The service role key of the Supabase project you created in step 2.
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key used to sign the JWT tokens, also from Supabase.
- `BOT_MODE`: The mode of the bot, can be `DEVELOPMENT` or `PRODUCTION`.

### 3.3. Change the database schema
The production version of gmon.link is using a different schema than the local version, this is because the production version is hosted by Monad Pad and we are using a different Supabase project for it.

To change the schema to public (default), you need to go to `/lib/clients/supabase.ts` and change the `schema` variable to `public`.

### 3.4. Start the bot
To start the bot, run the following command:
```bash
nodemon bot.ts
```

You can also run the bot with `ts-node` if you don't want to use `nodemon`.
```bash
ts-node bot.ts
```

You can now open Telegram and search for your bot, you can also send it messages to see if it works.
